## Kaijotic ðŸ‘‹  
I'm passionate about becoming a game developer. My goal is to create beautiful experiences for players and everyone. I aim to share my journey by building games and creating content that highlights the beauty and creativity in game development.  

While my technical foundation is a work in progress, my dedication to learning is demonstrated by my progress in Unity, C#, and my efforts to understand data structures and algorithms. Through side projects and self-study, I continue to push myself and explore innovative ways to solve problems.  

I'm currently studying Computer Science (as of 2025) and continuing to build on my knowledge and skills. My education helps me refine my technical abilities while also shaping my perspective on problem-solving and software development.  

Beyond game development, I am focused on improving myself and growing everyday. I want to foster a community of learners and gamers, encouraging collaboration and creativity.
