## Renderer  
> **Class in UnityEngine** | Inherits from: **Component** | Implemented in: **UnityEngine.CoreModule**  

### Description  
The **Renderer** is a core component in Unity responsible for rendering (drawing) objects onto the screen. It determines an object's appearance based on its **materials**, **textures**, **lighting**, and other visual properties. Renderers are crucial for displaying 3D objects (e.g., spheres, cubes, or custom meshes) and 2D objects (e.g., sprites).

---

### Key Features

- **Purpose:**  
  The Renderer component manages the visual representation of a GameObject. It defines how the object interacts with **lights**, **shadows**, and other visual effects.
  
  #### 1. Material
  Renderers use materials to define the object's **color**, **texture**, and **appearance**. Each material is linked to a **shader** that controls how the object interacts with light and textures.  

  useful properties and methods:

  ##### Properties 

  `renderer.material` Gets or sets the material. 
  ```csharp
  // Accessing and modifying the Renderer component
  Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
  Material mat = renderer.material; // Gets or sets the material
  ```  

  `renderer.sharedMaterial` Gets or sets the material shared by all instances.  
  ```csharp
  Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
  Material sharedMat = renderer.sharedMaterial; // Gets or sets shared material
  ```  

  `color (Material)`  Gets or sets the main color of the material.      
  ```csharp
  Material mat = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
  mat.color = Color.red; // Sets the material's color to red
  ```  

  `mainTexture (Material)`  Gets or sets the main texture of the material.       
  ```csharp
  Material mat = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
  mat.mainTexture = someTexture; // Sets the main texture
  ```  

  `mainTexture (Material)`  Gets or sets the shader of the material.       
  ```csharp
  Material mat = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
  mat.shader = Shader.Find("Standard"); // Sets the shader to Standard
  ``` 
  
  `HasProperty (Material)`  Checks whether the material has a given property.       
  ```csharp
  Material mat = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
  bool hasColor = mat.HasProperty("_Color"); // Returns true if '_Color' exists
  ``` 

  ##### Methods

  `SetTexture (Material)`  Sets a texture for a specific texture property of the material.       
  ```csharp
  Material mat = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
  mat.SetTexture("_MainTex", someTexture); // Sets the main texture
  ``` 

  `SetColor (Material)`  Sets the color for a specific color property of the material.         
  ```csharp
  Material mat = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
  mat.SetColor("_Color", Color.green); // Sets a custom color
  ``` 

  `SetFloat (Material)`  Sets a floating-point value for a shader property.  
  ```csharp
  Material mat = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
  mat.SetFloat("_Glossiness", 0.5f); // Sets glossiness
  ``` 

    `SetInt (Material)`  Sets an integer value for a shader property.     
  ```csharp
  Material mat = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
  mat.SetInt("_SomeIntProperty", 2); // Sets an integer property
  ``` 

    `GetTexture (Material)`  Gets the texture assigned to a specific texture property of the material.  
  ```csharp
  Material mat = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
  Texture tex = mat.GetTexture("_MainTex"); // Gets the main texture
  ``` 

  `GetColor (Material)`  Gets the color assigned to a specific color property of the material.  
  ```csharp

  Color color = mat.GetColor("_Color"); // Gets the color property
  ``` 

  `GetFloat (Material)`  Gets a floating-point value assigned to a specific shader property.  
  ```csharp
  Material mat = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
  float glossiness = mat.GetFloat("_Glossiness"); // Gets glossiness value
  ``` 

  `CopyPropertiesFromMaterial (Material)`   Copies the properties from another material to this one (except the shader).
  ```csharp
  Material mat1 = GetComponent<Renderer>().material;
  Material mat2 = anotherMaterial;
  mat1.CopyPropertiesFromMaterial(mat2); // Copies properties from mat2 to mat1
  ```

  `SetTextureOffset (Material)`   Sets the offset for a texture property (shifts the texture).  
  ```csharp

  #### 2. Shadows

  Unity uses shadows to create depth and realism in 3D environments. You can control whether an object casts shadows, receives shadows, or both. This is done via properties in the Renderer component of the GameObject.  

  ##### Key Properties for Shadows 
  ###### Shadow Casting Mode
  `Renderer.shadowCastingMode` Controls whether the object casts shadows and how it does so.  

  Options (from `UnityEngine.Rendering.ShadowCastingMode`):  
    
  `On` The object casts shadows normally.  
  `Off` The object does not cast shadows.  
  `TwoSided` The object casts shadows on both sides of its surface.  
  `ShadowsOnly` The object does not render itself but still casts shadows.  

  ![Shadow Casting Mode](/images/unity-shadow-casting-mode.png)
  
  **Example**  
  Enabling shadow casting to `on` using script   
  
  ```csharp
  Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
  renderer.shadowCastingMode = UnityEngine.Rendering.ShadowCastingMode.On; // Enable shadow casting
  ```  
  
  ---

  ###### Receive Shadows
  `Renderer.receiveShadows` Determines whether the object receives shadows from other objects.  

  Options   
  `true` The object receives shadows.  
  `false` The object does not receive shadows.  

  ---

  `true` The object receives shadows (in this case the police car ðŸ‘®ðŸš“).    
  **Sample Code:**      
  ```csharp
  Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
  renderer.receiveShadows = true; // Enable receiving shadows
  ```

  ![`true` The object receives shadows.](/images/unity-receive-shadows-on.png)  

  ---
    
  `false` The object does not receive shadows (in this case the police car ðŸ‘®ðŸš“).  
  **Sampe Code**  
  ```csharp
  Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
  renderer.receiveShadows = false; // Disable shadows
  ```

  ![`false` The object does not receive shadows. ](/images/unity-receive-shadows-off.png)  

  ---

  ##### When to Use Shadow Properties
  - Performance Optimization
    - Disable shadow casting (`ShadowCastingMode.Off`) for objects that donâ€™t need shadows (e.g., background or small decorative items).
    - Disable receiving shadows for objects where shadows are not critical.
  - Special Effects
    - Use `ShadowsOnly` for invisible objects that need to cast shadows for unique lighting effects.
    - Use `TwoSided` for thin objects like planes where shadows should appear on both sides.

  ##### Related Components
  1. Ligth
     - Shadows also depend on lights in the scene. Ensure the light source has shadows enabled  
        - `Light.shadowType` Determines whether a light casts shadows  
        - Options `Hard Shadows`, `Soft Shadows`, or `No Shadows`.

      ![Ligth Shadow Type](/images/unity-ligth-shadow-types.png)
  2. Quality Settings
      - The quality settings in Unity (Edit â†’ Project Settings â†’ Quality) determine global shadow behavior, such as shadow resolution, distance, and cascades.  
  3. Shader Settings  
      - The shader used by the material must support shadows. Some shaders (e.g., `Unlit`) do not interact with shadows.  

  ##### Common Methods for Shadows

  `Renderer.shadowCastingMode` Sets how the object casts shadows.
  ```csharp
  Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
  renderer.shadowCastingMode = UnityEngine.Rendering.ShadowCastingMode.On; // Cast shadows
  ```

  `Renderer.receiveShadows` Sets whether the object receives shadows from other objects.
  ```csharp
  Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
  renderer.receiveShadows = true; // Enable receiving shadows
  ```

  `Light.shadowStrength` Controls the opacity of the shadows cast by the light. A value between `0` (no shadows) and `1` (fully opaque shadows).
  ```csharp
  Light light = GetComponent<Light>();
  light.shadowStrength = 0.5f; // Semi-transparent shadows
  ```

  `Light.shadowBias` Sets the distance between the object and its shadow. Adjusting this can fix issues like **"shadow acne"** (unwanted shadow artifacts).
  ```csharp
  Light light = GetComponent<Light>();
  light.shadowBias = 0.005f; // Adjust shadow bias to remove artifacts
  ```

  `Light.shadowNormalBias` Adjusts shadow bias based on the angle between the light and the surface.
  ```csharp
  Light light = GetComponent<Light>();
  light.shadowNormalBias = 0.4f; // Fix self-shadowing artifacts
  ```
  
  `QualitySettings.shadowDistance` Sets the maximum distance from the camera where shadows are rendered.
  ```csharp
  QualitySettings.shadowDistance = 50.0f; // Render shadows up to 50 units away
  ```
  
  `Light.shadows` Toggles shadows for the light (None, Hard Shadows, or Soft Shadows).
  ```csharp
  Light light = GetComponent<Light>();
  light.shadows = LightShadows.Soft; // Enable soft shadows
  ```
 
  `Renderer.bounds` Returns the bounding volume of the object, which is used for shadow calculations.
  ```csharp
  Renderer renderer = GetComponent<Renderer>();
  Bounds bounds = renderer.bounds; // Get object bounds for shadow adjustments
  ```

  ##### Useful Combinations
  ###### Example 1: Toggle Shadows Dynamically
  
  ```csharp
    void ToggleShadows(GameObject obj, bool enable)
    {
        Renderer renderer = obj.GetComponent<Renderer>();
        renderer.shadowCastingMode = enable ? 
            UnityEngine.Rendering.ShadowCastingMode.On : 
            UnityEngine.Rendering.ShadowCastingMode.Off;
        renderer.receiveShadows = enable;
    }
  ```

    ###### Example 2: Adjust Shadow Quality at Runtime
  
  ```csharp
    void SetShadowQuality(float distance, LightShadows shadowType)
    {
        QualitySettings.shadowDistance = distance;
        Light mainLight = FindObjectOfType<Light>();
        if (mainLight != null)
        {
            mainLight.shadows = shadowType;
        }
    }
  ```

  #### 3. Sorting Layer and Order (For 2D Objects)
  Sorting layers and order are crucial in 2D games to determine which objects appear in front of or behind others. Unity uses Sorting Layers and Sorting Order to manage the rendering order of 2D objects.  
  
  ![Sorting Layer](/images/unity-sorting-layer.png)

  ##### Sorting Layers
  Sorting layers are like groups that define the rendering priority of objects. For example, you might have layers such as  
  - **Background** For distant scenery.  
  - **Foreground** For characters or objects closer to the camera.  
  - **UI** For game interfaces.  
  
  The objects in higher layers (with a higher priority in the "Sorting Layers" settings) are rendered on top of those in lower layers.  

  ##### Sorting Order
  Within a sorting layer, objects are drawn based on their **Sorting Order**.  
  - **Lower sorting order** The object is rendered earlier (appears behind).  
  - **Higher sorting order** The object is rendered later (appears on top).    

  - **Additional Controls:**  
    - **Order in Layer:** Fine-tunes the draw order of objects within the same sorting layer. A higher number is rendered in front of a lower number.

  #### 4. Rendering Layer Mask?
  The `Rendering Layer Mask` is a property of the `Renderer` component in Unity. It acts as a **bitmask** to define which rendering layers the object belongs to. These layers can then be used by rendering features like cameras, lights, or post-processing effects to include or exclude objects. **It supports 31 layers**  

  ![Rendering Layer Mask](/images/unity-rendering-layer-mask.png)

  ---

  ##### Key Concepts to Understand

  1. **What is a Bitmask?**
      - A **bitmask** is a way to represent multiple values using bits in an integer.
      - In Unity, a bitmask is often used for layers. Each bit represents a layer, and you can combine multiple layers using bitwise operations like `<<` (left shift) and `|` (bitwise OR).

  2. **How does it differ from Sorting Layers or Layers?**
      - **Sorting Layers**: Used mainly for 2D objects to determine draw order.
      - **Layers**: Used for physics interactions, collision detection, and camera culling.
      - **Rendering Layers (Rendering Layer Mask)**: A separate system specifically for controlling rendering behavior. It doesnâ€™t affect physics or game logic.

  3. **How does it work?**
      - The `Renderer.renderingLayerMask` determines which rendering layers the object belongs to.
      - Other components, like lights or custom shaders, can be configured to interact only with objects in specific rendering layers.

  ---

  ##### Practical Applications

  1. **Restricting Lights to Specific Objects**
      - You can configure lights to only affect objects in certain rendering layers. For example, you might have a spotlight that only illuminates a character while ignoring the environment.

  2. **Custom Rendering Effects**
      - Rendering layers can be used with custom shaders or post-processing effects to apply specific effects to certain objects.

  3. **Optimizing Performance**
      - By selectively including or excluding objects from rendering calculations, you can optimize the performance of your game.

  ---


  #### 5. Additional Notes
  
  Each of these features is built into the `Renderer` class, so you donâ€™t need separate standalone classes like `Material`. Instead, you access and control these properties directly through the `Renderer` API.

  The `Renderer` class serves as a bridge that connects all the visual aspects (materials, shadows, sorting, and rendering layers) to the object being displayed. While the `Material` class is distinct because it specifically manages shaders, colors, and textures, the rest of the features (e.g., shadows, sorting layers) are considered attributes or settings of the renderer.
